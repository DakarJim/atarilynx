# Atari [Lynx] Gamer
This is the official source code repository for my side-project, [Atari Gamer](http://atarigamer.com). More content will be added as the programming section on the website expands.

All source code, unless stated, is written by me (Igor Kromin).

# Building Code
The target architecture is Atari Lynx and requires the [CC65](http://cc65.github.io) compiler set up.

Although all the source code (C and Assembly) is for the Lynx, other files like Makefile and any scripts are targetted for use on macOS only. No attempt is made (at this point) to make these build on any other host system but macOS.

Generaly each project can be built with ```make all```.
